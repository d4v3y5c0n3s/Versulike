# Versulike
This is my attempt to recreate an interactive fiction tool known as [Versu](https://versu.com/) using Prolog.
## Status
While the code is usable there is no documentation nor are there any examples to reference.
## Goals
I'm in the process of working on a simple demo to show how to use this tool while I continue adding more features.  I see this project as something smaller I can more easily fit into my busy schedule.  My goal for this project is just to build something that is fun & cool. :)
